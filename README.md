This is a story looking at what Hollywood movies don't get released in India. This has been submitted to the Hindustan Times, am putting this out there to get feedback before it's published. You can read it online [here](https://shijithpk.github.io/hollywood_releases_in_india/index.html).

Most of the data for the story was taken from [the-numbers.com](http://the-numbers.com) and IMDB(http://imdb.com). The Bookmyshow team also helped me out with some [data](data/bookmyshow_list.csv).

You can find the python code used to scrape the webpages and analyse the data in this [jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shijithpk/hollywood_releases_in_india/blob/master/us_india_diff.ipynb). The notebook also has a summary of the different steps I took in the analysis.

 Can't share much of the data I used, that belongs to the various movie websites, so I can't redistribute it. But the github repo does have the final dataset I used to arrive at my results. It's available as a csv [here](data/india_release_check_v20.csv).

If you’re an econometrician, statistician or data scientist and think I should have done something differently in this analysis, do let me know! You can contact me on twitter at [@shijith](https://twitter.com/shijith) and by email at [mail@shijith.com](mailto:mail@shijith.com).
